# Shopping List App

A simple Shopping List app built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData** (iOS 17+) that supports:
- Add / Edit / Delete items
- Mark items as purchased
- Filter by category and display items grouped by category
- Persistence between app launches

## Requirements
- **Xcode 26**
- **iOS 17+** simulator or device

## Build & Run
1. Open the project in Xcode:
   - Double-click `Shopping List.xcodeproj`
2. Select a run destination:
   - Choose an **iOS 17+ simulator** (e.g., iPhone 15) or a connected device.
3. Run the app:
   - Press **⌘R** (or click the **Run** button).

## Notes
- Data is stored locally using **SwiftData**, so items will remain after closing and reopening the app.
- If you want a clean start during development, uninstall the app from the simulator/device to clear stored data.
